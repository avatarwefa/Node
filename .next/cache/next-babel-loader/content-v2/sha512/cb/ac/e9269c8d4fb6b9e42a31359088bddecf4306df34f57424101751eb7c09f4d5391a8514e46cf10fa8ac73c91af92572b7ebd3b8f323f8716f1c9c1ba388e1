The introduction of new Characters both good and bad also makes the movie more exciting. giving the characters more of a back story can also help audiences relate more to different characters better, and it connects a bond between the audience and actors or characters. Having seen the movie three times does not bother me here as it is as thrilling and exciting every time I am watching it. In other words, the movie is by far better than previous movies (and I do love everything Marvel), the plotting is splendid (they really do out do themselves in each film, there are no problems watching it more than once.'\n}, {\n  title: 'Back on the Bond Bandwagon',\n  rate: 7,\n  time: '23 December 2012',\n  reviewedBy: 'ChiSox3514',\n  body: \"As a lifelong James Bond enthusiast who has been extremely disappointed with the franchise's latest efforts (with the exception of Casino Royale), I was extremely pleased with this film. It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn't have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions, ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive, and let's not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare. So what does Skyfall have that the other Bond films don't? For the first time, we get a glimpse into our mysterious hero's dark past. Where he came from and what made him the person he is today.\"\n}, {\n  title: 'How safe do you feel?',\n  rate: 9,\n  time: '17 December 2016',\n  reviewedBy: 'hawaiipierson',\n  body: \"Bond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes M (Dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view. There is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want, but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results.\"\n}];\n\nfunction MovieDetail(_ref) {\n  _s();\n\n  var _this = this;\n\n  var comments = _ref.comments;\n\n  var

The introduction of new Characters both good and bad also makes the movie more exciting. giving the characters more of a back story can also help audiences relate more to different characters better, and it connects a bond between the audience and actors or characters. Having seen the movie three times does not bother me here as it is as thrilling and exciting every time I am watching it. In other words, the movie is by far better than previous movies (and I do love everything Marvel), the plotting is splendid (they really do out do themselves in each film, there are no problems watching it more than once.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        title: 'Back on the Bond Bandwagon',\r\n        rate: 7,\r\n        time: '23 December 2012',\r\n        reviewedBy: 'ChiSox3514',\r\n        body: \"As a lifelong James Bond enthusiast who has been extremely disappointed with the franchise's latest efforts (with the exception of Casino Royale), I was extremely pleased with this film. It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn't have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions, ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive, and let's not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare. So what does Skyfall have that the other Bond films don't? For the first time, we get a glimpse into our mysterious hero's dark past. Where he came from and what made him the person he is today.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        title: 'How safe do you feel?',\r\n        rate: 9,\r\n        time: '17 December 2016',\r\n        reviewedBy: 'hawaiipierson',\r\n        body: \"Bond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes M (Dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view. There is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want, but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results.\"\r\n    },\r\n]\r\nfunction MovieDetail({ comments }) {\r\n    let [showReview, setShowReview] =

The introduction of new Characters both good and bad also makes the movie more exciting. giving the characters more of a back story can also help audiences relate more to different characters better, and it connects a bond between the audience and actors or characters. Having seen the movie three times does not bother me here as it is as thrilling and exciting every time I am watching it. In other words, the movie is by far better than previous movies (and I do love everything Marvel), the plotting is splendid (they really do out do themselves in each film, there are no problems watching it more than once.</p>\r\n                                                        </div>\r\n                                                        <div className=\"mv-user-review-item\">\r\n                                                            <div className=\"user-infor\">\r\n                                                                <img src=\"images/uploads/userava2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n                                                                <div>\r\n                                                                    <h3>Just about as good as the first one!</h3>\r\n                                                                    <div className=\"no-star\">\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                    </div>\r\n                                                                    <p className=\"time\">\r\n                                                                        17 December 2016 by <a href=\"#\"> hawaiipierson</a>\r\n                                                                    </p>\r\n                                                                </div>\r\n                                                            </div>\r\n                                                            <p>Avengers Age of Ultron is an excellent sequel and a worthy MCU title!

And with that action comes visuals. The visuals are really good, even though you can see clearly where they are through the movie, but that doesn't detract from the experience. While all the CGI glory is taking place, there are lovable characters that are in the mix. First off the original characters, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, are just as brilliant as they are always. And Joss Whedon fixed my main problem in the first Avengers by putting in more Hawkeye and him more fleshed out. Then there is the new Avengers, Quicksilver, Scarletwich, and Vision, they are pretty cool in my opinion. Vision in particular is pretty amazing in all his scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n                                                            <p>THE BAD:</p>\r\n\r\n                                                            <p>The beginning of the film it's fine until towards the second act and there is when it starts to feel a little rushed.

The world is indeed an infinitely more complex place than the world of Marvel comics with clearly identifiable heroes and villains. But I get the feeling that from Robert Downey, Jr. on down the organizer and prime mover as Iron Man behind the Avengers these players do love doing these roles because it's a lot of fun. If they didn't show that spirit of fun to the audience than these films would never be made.</p>\r\n\r\n                                                            <p>So in that spirit of fun Avengers: Age Of Ultron comes before us and everyone looks like they're having a good time saving the world. A computer program got loose and took form in this dimension named Ultron and James Spader who is completely unrecognizable is running amuck in the earth. No doubt Star Trek fans took notice that this guy's mission is to cleanse the earth much like that old earth probe NOMAD which got its programming mixed up in that classNameic Star Trek prime story. Wouldst Captain James T. Kirk of the Enterprise had a crew like Downey has at his command.</p>\r\n                                                            <p>My favorite is always Chris Evans because of the whole cast he best gets into the spirit of being a superhero. Of all of them, he's already played two superheroes, Captain America and Johnny Storm the Human Torch. I'll be before he's done Evans will play a couple of more as long as the money's good and he enjoys it.</p>\r\n\r\n                                                            <p>Pretend you're a kid again and enjoy, don't take it so seriously.</p>\r\n                                                        </div>\r\n                                                        <div className=\"mv-user-review-item last\">\r\n                                                            <div className=\"user-infor\">\r\n                                                                <img src=\"images/uploads/userava5.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n                                                                <div>\r\n                                                                    <h3>Impressive Special Effects and Cast</h3>\r\n                                                                    <div className=\"no-star\">\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star last\"></i>\r\n                                                                        <i className=\"ion-android-star last\"></i>\r\n                                                                    </div>\r\n                                                                    <p className=\"time\">\r\n                                                                        26 March 2017 by <a href=\"#\"> johnnylee</a>\r\n                                                                    </p>\r\n                                                                </div>\r\n                                                            </div>\r\n                                                            <p>The Avengers raid a Hydra base in Sokovia commanded by Strucker and they retrieve Loki's scepter. They also discover that Strucker had been conducting experiments with the orphan twins Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who has super speed, and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), who can control minds and project energy. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) discovers an Artificial Intelligence in the scepter and convinces Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to secretly help him to transfer the A.I. to his Ultron defense system. However, the Ultron understands that is necessary to annihilate mankind to save the planet, attacks the Avengers and flees to Sokovia with the scepter. He builds an armature for self-protection and robots for his army and teams up with the twins. The Avengers go to Clinton Barton's house to recover, but out of the blue, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives and convinces them to fight against Ultron. Will they succeed? </p>\r\n\r\n                                                            <p>\"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" is an entertaining adventure with impressive special effects and cast. The storyline might be better, since most of the characters do not show any chemistry. However, it is worthwhile watching this film since the amazing special effects are not possible to be described in words. Why Pietro has to die is also not possible to be explained. My vote is eight.</p>\r\n                                                        </div>\r\n                                                        <div className=\"topbar-filter\">\r\n                                                            <label>Reviews per page:</label>\r\n                                                            <select>\r\n                                                                <option value=\"range\">5 Reviews</option>\r\n                                                                <option value=\"saab\">10 Reviews</option>\r\n                                                            </select>\r\n                                                            <div className=\"pagination2\">\r\n                                                                <span>Page 1 of 6:</span>\r\n                                                                <a className=\"active\" href=\"#\">1</a>\r\n                                                                <a href=\"#\">2</a>\r\n                                                                <a href=\"#\">3</a>\r\n                                                                <a href=\"#\">4</a>\r\n                                                                <a href=\"#\">5</a>\r\n                                                                <a href=\"#\">6</a>\r\n                                                                <a href=\"#\"><i className=\"ion-arrow-right-b\"></i></a>\r\n                                                            </div>\r\n                                                        </div>\r\n                                                    </div>\r\n                                                </div>\r\n                                                <div id=\"cast\" className=\"tab\">\r\n                                                    <div className=\"row\">\r\n                                                        <h3>Cast & Crew of</h3>\r\n                                                        <h2>Avengers: Age of Ultron</h2>\r\n                                                        <div className=\"title-hd-sm\">\r\n                                                            <h4>Directors & Credit Writers</h4>\r\n                                                        </div>\r\n                                                        <div className=\"mvcast-item\">\r\n                                                            <div className=\"cast-it\">\r\n                                                                <div className=\"cast-left\">\r\n                                                                    <h4>JW</h4>\r\n                                                                    <a href=\"#\">Joss Whedon</a>\r\n                                                                </div>\r\n                                                                <p>...
